## About
This mod offers a better dueling experience in a custom-made arena that is easily accessible from The Roundtable Hold. It works with the Seamless Coop mod, so there's no risk of getting banned as Seamless prevents you from connecting to FromSoftware's matchmaking servers.

## Features
* Items that activates auto-revive, unlimited item use and free cam item.
* Team fight and Brawl mode.
* Lilbro Merchant where you can buy every item, weapon, armor in the game for free.
* You can edit your stats with rebirth and strengthen your newly bought weapons.
* Three dueling arenas side by side for faster duels with reduced downtime.
