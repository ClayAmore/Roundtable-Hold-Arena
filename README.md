## About
This mod offers a better dueling experience in a custom-made arena that is easily accessible from The Roundtable Hold. It works with the Seamless Coop mod, so there's no risk of getting banned as Seamless prevents you from connecting to FromSoftware's matchmaking servers.

## Features
* Items that activates auto revive and unlimited item use.
* Lilbro Merchant where you can buy every item, weapon, armor in the game for free.
* You can edit your stats with rebirth and strengthen your newly bought weapons.
* Better viewing experience using the arenas telescope.
* Three dueling arenas side by side for faster duels with reduced downtime. 

## Requirments
This mod relies on the Seamless Coop mod. You can get Seamless Coop from their [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) or from their [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease/releases). Make sure to follow the seamless installation guide.

## Installation
1. Download the mod from the 'Download' tab.
2. Extract the package you downloaded and place the `Roundtable.Hold.Arena.0.98.beta` folder in the Elden Ring game folder.
4. Edit "seamlesscoopsettings.ini" to your chosen co-op password.
5. Launch the mod using RoundtableHoldArenaLaunch.exe.

## Credits
This mod would not have been possible without the amazing work of LukeYui and his Seamless Coop mod. A big thanks to the Grandmerchant maker for allowing me to use some of their code for the Lilbro merchant. Also, thanks to tremwil for guiding me through some of the more challenging parts of this mod. And, of course, thanks to everyone who created the modding tools for Elden Ring!
